Hi! I am Rupam Bhattacharyya. I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/). I work as a Graduate Student Research Assistant in the [BayesRx Research Group](http://bayesrx.com/) led by [Prof. Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/baladandayuthapani-veerabhadran.html), who is also my doctoral advisor, jointly with [Prof. Nicholas Henderson](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/henderson-nicholas.html). My research primarily focuses on precision oncology, epidemiological modeling, and Bayesian statistics, alongside other avenues of Biostatistics.

Born in the serene city of [Krishnanagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnanagar,_Nadia) in West Bengal, India, I spent the larger part of my childhood in the nearby town of [Santipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantipur), where I did my schooling from [Shishu Kakali Primary School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/) and [Santipur Municipal High School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/). I then joined the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) to get my bachelor's and master's degrees in statistics.

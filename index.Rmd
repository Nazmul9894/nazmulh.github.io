Hi! I have completed my Bachelor's in Statistics and did a research internship for three months in the Health Systems & Population Studies Division (HSPSD) at icddr,b. Currently, I am teaching "Categorical Data Analysis" course and conducting "Categorical Data Analysis", "Time Series", Biostatistics lab classes to a group of young statisticians in the Statistics Department, primarily fourth-year undergraduates.

Born in the bucolic countryside of [Magura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magura_District), Khulna, Bangladesh. I spent the larger part of my childhood in Nohata nearby [Mohammadpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammadpur_Upazila), where I attended [Nohata Rani Patit Paboni High School](https://nohataranipatitapabanisecondaryschool.jessoreboard.gov.bd/) . After that, I moved to Dhaka and was admitted to [BAF Shaheen College Dhaka](https://www.bafsd.edu.bd/) . Later, I pursued my bachelor's degree in Statistics from [Government Titumir College, University of Dhaka](https://7college.du.ac.bd/).
